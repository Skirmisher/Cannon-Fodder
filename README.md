Cannon Fodder
=============

Cannon Fodder is this random turret shooter thing that a bunch of people did at Hack SI on November 2, 2013. Use the arrow keys to rotate the turret, and press/hold space to fire. Shoot the things. Nothing really happens otherwise :P
The game was built with Unity in C#, and the models were created in 3DS Max.

People involved:
*Bill Cheng - Pretty much all the scripting, general Unity management
*Cory Vine - Modeler
*Josh Murray - Modeler
*Will Springer - Organization, dev environment setup, design input, other miscellaneous bits
*Zach Glass - That one guy who threw some thoughts out and played Warframe the rest of the time
*Matt - "Moral support"

Stuff used:
*Music: "Son of a Rocket" - Kevin MacLeod
*Sound effects: A couple random websites that probably didn't have sufficient credit information anyhow
*Explosions: Detonator Explosion Framework by Ben Throop
